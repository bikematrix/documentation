# Introduction

Thank you for installing the Bike Matrix App. This page describes the process for getting the App up running on your Storefront.

The components of the Bike Matrix App are outlined below. Steps 1 & 2 are mandatory for the Bike Matrix App to function correctly.

1. The main Bike Selector App Embed Block in the Theme which allows you to toggle the Bike Matrix App on or off, and set some key settings

2. The Bike Icon in the Header which allows the customer to select this icon which will show the Bike Selector popup so they can select their bike

3. The Product Check Panel on a Product Description Page which shows bike compatibility for the product and any variants for the selected bike

4. The Bike Compatibility List Panel on a Collection Page which shows only compatible products for the chosen bike

5. The Product Collection Compatibility Result on a Collection Page which shows a bike compatibility icon on each product in the collection

6. Configure the App Proxy to ensure the App can call out to the Bike Matrix API/Database to check compatibility for your products
