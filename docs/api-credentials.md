# API Credentials

## Obtaining API Credentials

The Web Components require access to the Bike Matrix API. To request access to the Bike Matrix API send us an email at adamb@bikematrix.io and we will create your subscription and provide you with access to our staging APIs allowing you to explore and test functionality.

When youâ€™re ready, we can activate your licence and provide access to the entire bike database through the Production API. Depending on your deployment scenario we will provide an API Key or we will add your environments information to our whitelist.
