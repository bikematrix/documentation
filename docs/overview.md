# Overview

This documentation is designed to allow you to quickly understand and integrate Bike Matrix into your offering.

Please [contact us](https://www.bikematrix.io/contact) with any feedback or questions you may have.

### How Bike Matrix works?

We provide an API which checks if a product SKU is compatible with a bike. The bike is defined by a unique Bike Matrix key, therefore before checking SKU compatibility a bike selection process would have to take place.

We have created a web components solution for customers to use, allowing fast and simple integration. These web components allow for bike selection, saving the bike in session storage, which is then used by other components for running compatibility checks on the SKUs for that web page.
