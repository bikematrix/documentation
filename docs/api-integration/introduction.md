# API Introduction

The **API** integration with Bike Matrix allows for creation of a fully customisable compatibility solution.

Our production API URL is `"https://api.bikematrix.io/proxy/v3/"`.

Theres are two main steps to using our API:

- [Setting up authentication](docs/api-integration/authentication.md) with our API.
- [Querying our endpoints](docs/api-integration/endpoints/overview.md) to find compatibility.
