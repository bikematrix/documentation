# Configure App Proxy

Ensure that the Storefront can communicate with the Bike Matrix App (and the compatibility logic) by ensuring the App Proxy is set up correctly.

1. From your Shopify admin, go to Settings > Apps and sales channels > Bike Matrix.
2. Scroll to the App proxy card, and ensure the App Proxy Url is:

   https://\<store name>.myshopify.com/apps/proxy

3. If it does not end with '/apps/proxy' then click 'Customize URL' and update the URL
