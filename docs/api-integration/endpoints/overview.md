# Overview

Our endpoints are separated into 3 groups:

## Bike Endpoints

These endpoints are designed around finding a bike key to be used in the compatibility endpoints.

Check out the [bike endpoints](docs/api-integration/endpoints/bike/overview.md).

## Compatibility Endpoints

These endpoints are designed around getting the compatibility results for a bike key for one or more SKUs.

Check out the [compatibility endpoints](docs/api-integration/endpoints/compatibility/overview.md).

## Product Endpoints

These endpoints are designed around discovering which SKUs Bike Matrix supports.

Check out the [product endpoints](docs/api-integration/endpoints/product/overview.md).
