# 3. Service Level - Availability

During the Term, we will use commercially reasonable efforts to provide you with our Services in accordance with the Availability Target.

If in any calendar month you encounter a Failure, you may claim the applicable Service Credit in accordance with the terms of this Service Level Agreement. To claim a Service Credit, you must send us notice to our email for notices (as set out in clause 11.7 of the Agreement) within 30 days of the end of the calendar month in which the Failure occurred (Service Credit Request). A Service Credit Request must include details of all the dates and times in which you experienced the Downtime in the relevant calendar month and any other information reasonably requested by us.

During the Term, the Service Credits are to be calculated as follows:

| Availability   | Service Credit |
| -------------- | -------------- |
| 98.5% - 99.89% | 5%             |
| 97% - 98.49%   | 10%            |
| < 97%          | 20%            |

If we assess your Service Credit Request and confirm that we have not met the Availability Target, we will:

a. where the Term has not ended, apply the relevant Service Credit based on the Availability achieved to the Fees in the next invoice for our Services; or

b. where the Term has ended, apply the relevant Service Credit based on the Availability achieved to the Fees in the last invoice for our Services in the Term and issue a refund of that amount.

Service Credits are non-transferrable and, subject to clause 3.4(b), are not redeemable for cash.

Despite anything to the contrary, you are not entitled to any Service Credit:

a. that, where clause 3.4(a) applies, exceeds 100% of the Fees due in the next invoice;

b. that, where clause 3.4(b) applies, exceeds 100% of the Fees in the last invoice for our Services in the Term;

c. for so long as any undisputed invoice is overdue; or

d. if you are in breach of the Agreement.
