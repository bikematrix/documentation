Ie. https://imagestore.bikematrix.io/cube-ams-one11-c68x-tm-29-2022/400-4a1c9.jpeg

### Bike Brand Product Category

As we continue to roll-out compatibility for new product categories and increase the number of bikes for which we have enriched the bike spec data, not all bikes have the same ability to process compatibility assessment, so we need to identify which product categories are available for each brand of bikes. We use this information in our Bike Selector to guide the customer to the available product categories for the selected brand.
With a given **bike_Brand_ID** you can get a list of available **product_Category_IDs** corresponding to a list of Product Categories using **GetBikeBrandProductCategories** call.
Ie. passing in a **bike_Brand_ID** of 6 (Trek) will return Brake Pads, Brake Rotor, Front Wheel, Rear Wheel, Wheelset, Tyre and Tube.

## Products

### Get Product

You can check if a product is in the Bike Matrix Database by calling **GetProduct** and passing in the **SKU** (EAN, UPC or Original Manufacturers Part Number).
Ie. passing a **sku** of 4550170639464 will return Brake Pad Shimano D02S-MX D Type Disc Pads Sintered Metallic Compound.

### Get Products With Results

You can check if a number of products are in the Bike Matrix Database by calling **GetProductsWithResults** and passing in an array of **SKUs** (EAN, UPC or Original Manufacturers Part Number) added to the body.

The result is an array, where for each SKU passed to the API, information on if it is supported and the product category will be provided.

## Check Compatibility

### Check Single SKU Compatibility

With a **bike_Key** and a **sku**, you can call **Compatibility_CheckSku** to determine if the specific part (by SKU EAN, UPC or Manufacturer Part Number) is compatible with the selected Bike.
Ie. passing **bike_Key** '8a113328-a512-4b14-8f31-711259d9c4c8' and **sku** of 4550170639464 will return a Compatibility Result of 'Compatible with Front and Rear Brake'.

### Check Batch SKU Compatibility With Results

With a **bike_Key** it is possible to send batches of SKUs by calling **Compatibility_CheckSkus** for bulk compatibility assessment. This is currently limited to batches of 50 SKUs and will return a result for every SKU that is passed in (not just a comma separated list of compatible SKUs). This allows detailed messages and warning indicators to be used.

## Obtaining Credentials

To request access to the Bike Matrix API, send us an email at adamb@bikematrix.io and we will create your subscription and provide you with access to our Staging environment APIs allowing you to explore and test functionality. Our Staging environment has a subset of the full bike database.
